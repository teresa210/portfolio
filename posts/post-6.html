            See where your inventory is currently selling, and publish new product listings out to your sales channels in bulk with just a few clicks. Sellbrite saves hours and hours of work, and also takes the risk out of expanding to new marketplaces. Simply select the products you want to list, choose the channel to list on, and Sellbrite creates perfect listings for you in real-time. Want to sell for different prices on each channel? No problem, you can customize prices, titles, descriptions and any other product data for each channel as you see fit.

            Simplify the way you list items and substantially improve your efficiency by creating reusable listing templates. Save common options and settings (such as shipping fees) for each channel in a template, then apply the template to new or existing listings for fast and easy listing creation or updates. Changes made to a template will automatically update all the listings with that template applied, saving you hours of work. Group various kinds of templates (shipping, pricing, etc.) together to create listing recipes for preparing the perfect listing.
